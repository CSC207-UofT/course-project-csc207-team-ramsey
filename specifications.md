### **Project Specifications**
The app allows users to have a practical meal planning experience with a straightforward and functional design. Users can start by adding all the ingredients that they have in their home into a list or pantry, with each food item containing its name, quantity, shelf life, and expiration date. Users may then use the recipe function to search for recipes based on specific preferences, such as key ingredient, availability of ingredients, or based on the expiration date of items in the userâ€™s pantry. If required items are not available, then item will be added to a shopping list for the user. The app allows users to add in their recipes, check their pantry, shopping list and will keep track of expiring items to alert the user before the date.
