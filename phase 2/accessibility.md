### Adherence to Universal Design Principles
Given that our application uses a command line interface, there is limited adherence
to some universal design principles throughout the program. However, this document will address some positive 
universal design aspects of our program as well as the major detriments
of using a CLI for our user. We will also discuss how these design principles can be  leveraged to improve our CLI
and how they can be used to transition into a more equitable graphical user interface in android, where each UDP could be 
related to user experience design principles.

#### 1) Equitable Use

The equitable use principle states that the design should be useful and marketable to people with diverse abilities. 
This design principle suggests that users should receive the same interaction with the application whenever possible so
that users will not be segregated or stigmatized. All users should receive relatively equivalent privacy, safety, and security
features. The interface design should also be equally appealing and aesthetically pleasing to all users. 

Given that our app is a recipe and food management app, our target market our consumers who cook on a regular basis.
