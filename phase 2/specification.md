### **Project Specifications**
Hi! Welcome to our project, Ricetta, created by the Chef of the Round Table. 
Our project works to make storing, creating, and buying foods as
simple as possible. We tried to create an experience where users can 
create a food they bought and add it to the program. Create recipes and 
..

###### User

When a user first opens the program they should be prompted with 
the option to create a new user. Old users of the program should be able to
log back into their accounts. Users should be able to update
their username and passwords through the terminal as well. When a new user is created
a kitchen is automatically created for the user. In the future we may add additional kitchens 
so that a user may have multiple, but as of now, the user may only have one kitchen.

###### Food

Once a user is all set up, they are now able to access all the commands that will be listed and detailed below.
They can create foods, which will be stored in the kitchen. Each food they create will have its own
name, shelf life, unit and a way to store the quantities. The food quantities are stored in 
a way that allows users to see when a quantity was added and when that quantity of food will expire. 
For instance, if we had a banana, users would first need to make a banana object. This banana would have an initial
quantity, lets say 7 for this example. If the user bought this banana and made the instance of the banana on Jan1 and the shelf life of a banana was 8 days, then
we know that it will expire on Jan 9th. These dates will be stored with each entry of quantity that will be added later on. 
So, if a user were to buy another 5 bananas 
the next day, a new entry would be stored with a different expiration date. 
When a user removes a quantity, the earliest date's quantity will be subtracted first and it will keep 
subtracting from the quantity of each next earliest day. 


Users will also be able to update the shelf life, name, and unit of their foods. 
In case they decide on another way of storing their foods, or if they wish to change the name of their food. 
Currently, users are not able to change the dates, because of the specificity of creating dates, but that would 
be a future feature that we would like to implement. Additionally, users
will also be able to sort their foods based on their type (Grains, fruits and vegetables, meats, dariy, and soups and condiments.)
They will also be able to sort their foods based on which foods will expire the soonest. 


Recipe - Users may also add their own recipes where they can use the recipe function to search for recipes based on specific preferences, such as key ingredient, availability of ingredients, or based on the expiration date of items in the userâ€™s pantry.

###### Kitchen + Shopping List

Users will be able to store their recipes, food, and shopping list in their kitchen. In their kitchen, users are able 
to see what food they currently have and select a recipe to make. If a recipe contains ingredients the user does not 
currently have, they can add their unowned ingredients to their shopping list based on the recipe. The user can take the 
items on the shopping list and add them to their kitchen after they obtain the items, upon which the items are removed from
the shopping list. 
### New functionality

We've added a User login, registration, and serialization using the Jackson Library. We've also added a few new commands to allow the user to

see the full list of recipes and food as wells as view recipes of a specific category which we've tagged in an enum.

**Login/Registration UI**

'login' = login a user

'sign up' - register a user
