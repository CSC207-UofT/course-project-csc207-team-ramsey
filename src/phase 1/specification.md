### **Project Specifications**
The app allows users to have a practical meal planning experience with a straightforward and functional design. It allows users to add in their recipes, check their pantry, shopping list and will keep track of expiring items to alert the user before the date.

Food - Users can start by adding all the ingredients/ foods that they have in their home, with each food item containing its name, quantity, shelf life, and expiration date. Users should be able see their foods based on certain criteria ie. expiration.

Recipe - Users may also add their own recipes where they can use the recipe function to search for recipes based on specific preferences, such as key ingredient, availability of ingredients, or based on the expiration date of items in the userâ€™s pantry.

Shopping List - If required items are not available, then item will be added to a shopping list for the user.

### New functionality
