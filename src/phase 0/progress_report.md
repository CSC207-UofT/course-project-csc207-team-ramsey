### **Summary**

Our project allows people to store their foods and recipes so that they can easily buy necessary ingredients, understand what recipes they can make, and helps track foods that may expire soon. 
We have 3 entity classes, User, Food and Recipe. 2 use case classes, FoodManager and RecipeManager, and one controller class, ControlCenter.
Users should be able to enter their name and their details, enter new foods, see their foods, enter new recipes, and see their recipes.

### **Questions**
Should each command line command have its own separate class?

Is it better to have public attributes, or to have functions that get the attributes?


### **What Worked Well**

Our group communication is on point. We have been able to meet very regularly and everyone communicates well. 

The way our classes have been interacting have been working well. Our entity classes only interact with each other and the managers help with the extra functions that are needed 



### **What we have been working on and plan to continue working on**

Everyone in our group worked on the CRC models, specification, and progress report together. We try to have meetings multiple times a week so that we can all be on the same page. 

**Marco** - ControlCenter, Use Cases (FoodManager, RecipeManager)

**Tosha** - Entity Classes (User, Food, Recipe), walkthrough

**Mer** - ControlCenter, progress report

**Martin** - CRC models, Specification

Since we all meet, our tasks tend to get a bit more entangled, but we all helped each other to complete as much as we can!

We still plan to add much for functionality to our program. We still want to work on, searching and ordering recipes and foods by certain categories. 
Adding updaters to change quantities or mistakes that the user may make. 
Adding a function that allows users to "make a recipe" so that the quantity may change automatically 
Creating functions that allow users to add their foods into a shopping list or automatically add food from recipes. 
Being able to change serving sizes so that users can change how much of something they want to make. 
For the shopping list we also want to be able to cross off food that we have bought.

The communication between our controlcenter and the managers still needs a bit more improvement. And we need to add more command line prompts for the user to go through.
We want to also add checks so that the user can see if their food or recipe was added correctly and if not they can try again. 
We also want to be able to display more specific information about foods and recipes. And add options to add items into a shopping list
